Advanced Resource Procurement

The ARP mod is meant as a mid to late game addition to resource procurement, adding a new energy source, a way to improve the yield on liquid resource and ore gathering, but at higher infrastructure requirements.

Sand:
Sand is a new natural resource for building things. You can get sand from deposits that appear naturally in the world, similar to stone deposits, or you can get it as a byproduct of Waste Water treatment. Sand can then be ran through an electric furnace to produce silicon wafers, which are used as an additional component of electronics.

Natural Gas:
A new energy resource, the Natural Gas resource will be very similar to the oil resource, treated as a fluid that can be obtained by wells. The difference is that a Natural Gas well will need to be prepared ahead of time using a drilling rig that uses water (or potentially a chemical solution) as the wells that you find in the world will start off showing depleted. Once the well is prepared, a well head can be substituted in to draw natural gas from the well.

Natural Gas is used in energy production. With the addition of Natural Gas will come the addition of boilers for creating steam with Natural Gas and Water as input, and will do a better job of heating up the water while causing less pollution per boiler unit. Electrical energy can also be generated directly from just burning Natural Gas, but not as efficiently as using steam engines. This gives you the option of powering something on a remote site with only Natural Gas when no water source is present.

Hydraulic Fracturing:
Also known as Fracking, this is the process by which a Natural Gas well is prepared. This process will require a powered drill rig at the site, and will take in either water or chemical inputs, and create waste water that must be dealt with. There will be two ways of dealing with waste water, one being far more polluting than the other. The rig will use up steel drill bits as part of its recipe, which means there is a cost to drilling the wells.

Waste Water:
A new output from drill rigs and chemical plants that process dirty ores. Waste Water has to be dealt with by either dumping it, or reprocessing it in a chemical plant. If you choose to dump the Waste Water using a special section of pipe, that section of pipe will generate a substantial amount of pollution depending on how much Waste Water passes through it. If instead you decide to process Waste Water through a Chemical Plant set to Water Purification, you will get most of the water returned to you as clean, usable water, and will get a small amount of Sludge that you have to deal with. At this time, the only way to deal with Sludge is to either fill up tanks with it, or dump it into the environment (it is far less polluting than Waste Water dumping simply because there is far less of it).

Well Head:
Natural Gas wells are not pumped like Oil Wells are. Instead, they are pressurized and use a Well Head that you can draw the Natural Gas from. So, instead of having a Pumpjack on a Natural Gas well, you will need a Well Head.

Steam Flooding:
There is a process to increase oil well production called Steam Flooding. This is the process of injecting steam deep into the ground near oil wells in order to heat up the oil and make it flow easier, allowing Pumpjack output to increase in the area around the Steam Injection Well. You will need to feed hot water into the Steam Injection Well, which is a good use for the Natural Gas boilers.

Optional More Complex Oil Production:
With the introduction of the Fracking mechanism for obtaining Natural Gas, the same drill rig prep requirement can be activated for Oil Wells. Also, when Oil or Natural Gas wells start to run dry, a drill rig can be setup on the depleted well in order to raise the yield back up to a maximum of 100%, which is ineffect ‘redrilling’ the well to obtain more resources from it.

Ore Veins:
In addition to the surface iron, copper, and coal, there will now be veins of these ores, but they will only spawn when the surface ore is depleted, and only if there are no other ore veins of the same type within a certain area around it. These veins can not be mined using the vanilla mining equipment, and instead require the new Deep Bore Drill. These Veins will be a yield based resource that will drop some over time, but will not drop below a certain yield percentage.

Deep Bore Drill:
The DBD is an electric powered drill that can only be used on ore veins. As an output, you get a ‘dirty’ version of the ore which can be processed at a chemical plant. The chemical plant can use water with the dirty ore to produce a larger quantity of useable ore and a by product of Waste Water.

Water Purification:
Since dumping Waste Water is bad for the environment, you have the option to pump it into a chemical plant and process it into three additional outputs, stone, water, and sludge. Stone and Water are two useful resources, where Sludge is not, and must be dumped. Sludge is also fairly bad for the environment, but it comes in far smaller quantities than Waste Water does, so overall you will pollute a lot less by dumping Sludge. The Stone output gives you another way to gather stone that doesn’t rely on exhaustible surface mining.

Please include all steps to reproducing the bug, and list any other mods (including their versions) that you may be running at the same time.

## Suggestions

If you have an idea that you would like to suggest for the mod, you may do so by creating a new [Issue](https://github.com/MatokHunt/Advanced-Resource-Procurement/issues) and explaining in detail what enhancemenmt you're thinking about.

## Code and Asset Contributions

If you would like to help add make the mod better, you may do so by creating a fork of this project, making your additions, and then creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/MatokHunt/Advanced-Resource-Procurement/pulls) if you wish for your changes to be merged into the master. While it can not be guaranteed that every pull request will be accepted, in general, any changes that make improvements to code stability and efficiency, as well as improvements to the assets, will be accepted. Pull requests that substantially alter or add to the mod’s game play mechanics may or may not be merged into the master depending on if the changes align with the mod’s original vision of adding interesting changes to Factorio’s mid to late game resource procurement.

You can always ask before forking and working on the project if your planned additions and changes would be accepted into the master.

Also, since the project is [licensed](LICENSE.md) under the MIT license, you can fork this project and make your own version with as many changes as you want if you wish.

Any contributors who make additions to the master branch of this project may be listed for supporting the project in the [readme](README.md).
